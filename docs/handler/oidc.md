# OIDCHandler — SSO / OpenID Connect

`OIDCHandler` integrates with any OpenID Connect provider (Google, GitHub, Okta, etc.) using PKCE and provider discovery.

## Configuration

```go
h, err := handler.NewOIDCHandler(
    ctx,
    userStore, jwtMgr,
    "https://accounts.google.com", // OIDC issuer URL (discovery performed at startup)
    clientID, clientSecret,
    "https://myapp.example.com/auth/oidc/callback",
    "session", true,
)
```

## Routes

```
GET  /auth/oidc/login                  → h.Login              // redirects to provider
GET  /auth/oidc/callback               → h.Callback           // handles provider redirect
POST /auth/oidc/link-nonce             → h.CreateLinkNonce    // issue nonce for linking (requires auth)
GET  /auth/oidc/link?nonce=<nonce>     → h.Link               // start link flow (requires auth)
```

## Callback behaviour

The callback performs PKCE verification and handles three cases automatically:

- **Existing OIDC subject** → log in
- **Existing email** → link subject and log in
- **New user** → create account

`Callback` does **not** return JSON. On success it sets the JWT in an `HttpOnly` session cookie and redirects the browser to `/?oidc_login=1` (HTTP 302) so that single-page applications can detect a completed OIDC login via the query parameter.

!!! info "Custom post-login redirect"
    The redirect destination is currently fixed to `/?oidc_login=1`. Frontends that need a custom post-login URL should rely on the `oidc_login=1` query parameter (or another explicit non-`HttpOnly` signal) to trigger navigation, rather than attempting to read the session cookie from browser JavaScript.

## Account linking

Account linking uses a short-lived (5-minute) HMAC-signed state token to protect the integrity of the linking flow. The state value is signed, not encrypted, so any embedded user identifier should be treated as visible to the browser and other parties that can inspect the redirect URL or related cookies.

## No refresh tokens

`OIDCHandler` does not have a `Sessions` field and issues an access JWT only (no refresh tokens). The token lifetime is determined by the configured `JWTManager` TTL, not enforced by `OIDCHandler` itself. If you need server-side session revocation and refresh-token rotation for OIDC logins, implement a custom callback flow that completes the OIDC exchange, creates a session, and issues tokens with the session-aware JWT API (for example, `JWTManager.CreateTokenWithSession`) together with your refresh-token flow.
